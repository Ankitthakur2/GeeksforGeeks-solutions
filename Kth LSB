A number N is given. Find its ‘K’th Least Significant Bit.

Example 1:

Input: N = 10, K = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: Binary Representation 
of 10 is 1010. 4th LSB is 1.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: N = 16, K = 3 
Output: 1 
Explanation: Binary Representation of 
16 is 10000. 3rd LSB is 0.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function KthLSB() which takes the N and K as inputs and returns the bit (1 or 0) in K'th LSB.
Expected Time Complexity: O(K)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
1 ≤ K ≤ 32

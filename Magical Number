Magical number is that seat no. where the person has the same age as that of the given seat number.
Help your friend in finding out that "Magical number"

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N, size of an array.
The second line of each test case contains N input A[].

Output:

Print "Magical Number"
Print "-1" when index value does not match with value. 

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
-1000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:
Input:
1
10
-10 -1 0 3 10 11 30 50 100 150

Output:
3

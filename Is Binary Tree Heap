Given a binary tree you need to check if it follows max heap property or not.
Input:
The task is to complete the method which takes one argument, root of Binary Tree. The struct Node has a data part which stores the data, pointer to left child and pointer to right child.There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:
The function should return true if property holds else false.
 

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 30
1 <=Number of nodes<= 100
1 <=Data of a node<= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2
5 2 L 5 3 R
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
1
0

There are two test cases.  First case represents a tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root is 5, left child of 5 is 2 and right child of 5 is 3.   Second test case represents a tree with 4 edges and 5 nodes.

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.

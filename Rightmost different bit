Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers.

Example 1: 

Input: M = 11, N = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of the given 
numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 
2nd bit from right is different.
Example 2:

Input: M = 52, N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: Binary representation of the given 
numbers are: 110100â€¬ and 0100, 
5th-bit from right is different.
User Task:
The task is to complete the function posOfRightMostDiffBit() which takes two arguments m and n and returns the position of first different bits in m and n. If both m and n are the same then return -1 in this case.

Expected Time Complexity: O(max(log m, log n)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= M <= 103
1 <= N <= 103

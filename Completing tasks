There are total N tasks given to a group of 5 students in a class.Three of those five students completed M tasks of their choices and left the group.Now the burden of completing remaining tasks is on the two students Tanya and Manya. Suppose the N tasks are in an array form 1,2,3,...N .Tanya and Manya decided to complete their remaining tasks in the following manner :- First of the remaining task is done by Tanya and the next remaining one by Manya .For example if N=10 and M=4 and the completed 4 tasks are{2,3,5,7},then the reamining tasks are{1,4,6,8,9,10}, so,Tanya completes{1,6,9} tasks and Manya completes{4,8,10}tasks and thereby completing the N tasks given.

Given N,M and the indexes (1 for first task,2 for second task and so on..)of completed tasks,find the tasks which Tanya and Manya have to complete.

Input:
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines.First Line contains the Integers N and M .Second line contains the list of M completed tasks.

Output:

The output for each test case consists of two lines. The first line is a list of the indices of the tasks which Tanya has to complete.The second line is a list of the indices of the tasks which Manya has to complete. Both lists must appear in increasing order of indices and consecutive integers should be separated by a single space. If either Tanya or Manya have no tasks to perform, then their corresponding line should be left blank.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=M<=N<=100

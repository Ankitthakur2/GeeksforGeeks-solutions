There is a hacker named "Vijay" who has developed a method to check whether an id at some social networking site is fake or real using its username.

His method includes: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then the user is a male, otherwise a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Vijay to determine the gender of this user by his method. Ignore the vowels.

Input:
The first line contains a integer T i.e. the number of test cases. Each test case contains string S that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name.

Output:
If it is a female by Vijay's method, print "SHE!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "HE!" (without the quotes).

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Length of string<=1000
 

Time Complexity:O(n)

Examples:
Input :
3
jpmztf
plkaitw
gfuyg

Output:
SHE!
HE!
HE!

Explanation:
For the first test case. There are 6 distinct characters in "jpmztf". These characters are: "j", "p", "m", "z", "t", "f". So jpmztf is a female and you should print "SHE!".

For the second example. There are 5 distinct characters in "plkaitw". These characters are: "p"," l ","k","t"and"w" as others are vowels. So plkaitw is a male and you should print "HE!".

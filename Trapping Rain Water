Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {3,0,0,2,0,4}
Output:
10
Explanation: 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
Output:
10
Explanation:
Water trapped by above 
block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
total unit of water trapped is 10 units.
Example 3:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {6,9,9}
Output:
0
Explanation:
No water will be trapped.

Your Task:
You don'y need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function trappingWater() which takes arr and N as input parameters and returns the total amount of water that can be trapped.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
3 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= Ai <= 10^8


int trappingWater(int arr[], int n){
        int left[n];
        left[0]=arr[0];
        int right[n];
        
        right[n-1]=arr[n-1];
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
        {
           left[i]=max(left[i-1],arr[i]);
            
        }
        int j=1;
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--)
        {
            right[i]=max(right[i+1],arr[i]);
            
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum=sum+min(right[i],left[i])-arr[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

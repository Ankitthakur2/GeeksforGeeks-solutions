Given an array arr[] of N positive integers. The task is to find the greatest smaller on left of every element in the array.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains size of array N and next line contains array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, print the array which contains greatest smaller element on left of every corresponding element in the array. For the element whose smaller on left doesn't exists, consider -1 as greatest smaller.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 108

Example:
Input:
1
5
2 3 4 5 1

Output:
-1 2 3 4 -1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Smallest element on left of 3 is 2, 4 is 3 and 5 is 1. Since 2 is the first element and no element on left is present, so it's greatest smaller element will be -1 and that for 1, no greatest smaller element is present on left, so it's greatest smaller element is -1.
